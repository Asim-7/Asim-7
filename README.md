# 👋 About Me

I’m a **Senior Software Engineer** with 9+ years of experience delivering high-impact mobile apps and scalable backend services. My expertise spans native Android (Kotlin/Java), cross-platform React Native (JS/TS), Flutter (Dart), and backend development with Java/Kotlin + Spring Boot.

I've contributed to large-scale apps like **TomTom GO Navigation (10M+ users)** and **Prowise Education Suite (100K+ users)**, and worked with startups and agencies on multiple 10K+ user apps.

I specialize in **end-to-end product delivery**, from UI to API, focusing on performance, maintainability, and a clean architecture.
